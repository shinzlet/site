Hi, I'm Seth! I build control systems for scientific instruments and hobby in
a handful of areas.
This is my blog, where I mostly intend to document personal projects and
announce software like [Phreak](https://shinzlet.github.io/posts/cli-builder/)
or [Oildrop](https://shinzlet.github.io/posts/oildrop/).

I love to collaborate with others - if you'd like to work together on a project,
feel free to contact me at [sethhinz@me.com](mailto:sethhinz@me.com). Currently,
my main areas of interest are scientific computing, microbiology, and
nanotechnology, but I also like working in new domains.

All opinions expressed on this site are my own, and do not reflect current or
future employers.
